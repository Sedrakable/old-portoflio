                            <div class= "message"> For as long as I can remember, I loved arts and crafts, as well as solving puzzles. Starting school at age 6, I excelled in mathematics and took extracurricular Arts courses, 
                                where I learned the basics of drawing, painting, and sculpting. I continued in that trajectory for three years until I moved to Canada. At that point, I continued my schooling in Canada, 
                                but since I didn't know the languages at the time, I could not take extra art classes. So I took the matter into my own hands and started doing Origami at home. It started with a paper plane 
                                and turned into complicated tessellations in a matter of 2 years. I was hooked. At this point, my family had to go back to Russia. For the next two years, I have mostly focused on studying. Then, yes again, 
                                I permanently moved back to Canada. I was lacking in the language department from all the moving, 
                                but my Math skills from Russia propelled me, and I finished my french high school (Collège français) faster than I anticipated. For all those years, I was still doing small projects on the side.

                            <div class= "message"> After high-school, I entered Vanier College, where I learned so much and changed a lot as a person. Knowing that I love mathematics and designing things, 
                                I decided to choose Computer Science and Mathematics as my course. At this point, I knew nothing about programming, but I was ready to learn. In 4 semesters, I learned Java, 
                                Java FX, and CSS. And I loved that experience. Additionally, for my complimentary courses, I chose a Painting and a Drawing course. That was probably one of the best decisions of my life.
                                 I loved every second of that experience, and those skills now help me create icons, logos, or any sort of asset for my programming projects.

                                so I decided to find a job for the time being. I joined Keywords Studios, a Video Game Testing Company as an FQA tester, 
                                I worked there for about a year. From there I learned different aspects of games and how to test them, how to work with others (as a team), learned to report issues, 
                                learned to communicate with developers, help recruits, and in general get tasks done as fast as possible. Additionally, I worked on Web (software) testing for one of my projects. 
                                In a year got to an Expert Tester and now I am ready to pursue a developer job.

                            <div class= "message"> Apart from Arts and Programming, I have a desire to stay fit and get better physically.
                                 Over the last 5 years, I've been focused on bodybuilding, calisthenics, and being as strong as possible. Currently, I focus on getting stronger in bodyweight exercises, like muscle-ups, front- lever, 
                                 back-lever, one arm pull-ups, pull-ups, dips, pushups, etc... As well as focusing on my diet to stay as lean as possible while getting bigger and stronger. Training has taught me discipline, consistency, 
                                 perseverance, and the importance of knowledge. The physical I as important as the mental, one compliments the other, and I will always focus on improving both.
